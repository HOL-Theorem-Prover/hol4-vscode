# TODOs

- The highlighting is bad. It is especially bad for terms in the logic. It would
  be better to set up something that would send terms to HOL and get a parse-
  tree with some useful information (e.g. types, where a constant is defined)
  back.
- There's some hacky code which tries to remove comments in text sent to the
  HOL repl. It doesn't work properly: it will get HOL into a bad state if there
  are nested comments, and it will remove comments inside string literals.
- The plugin doesn't attempt to insert load-calls the same way as emacs when
  it finds qualified ML identifiers (but maybe this is for the best?).
